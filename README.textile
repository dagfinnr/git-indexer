h1. git-indexer

This isn't really an indexer, so it is lying a bit right of the bat. What it really
does is look for JIRA issue IDs in commit messages in git, and then looks on github
for comments on those commits, storing it all on the correct issue in a mongodb

There is a second half of this, that is a jira plugin to display this as an issue
panel, but that is not quite ready for prime time, but it is comming

h1. config

We look for a config.json alongside the app, containing the following:

<pre><code>
{
    "org": "", // Your organization, we don't support single users atm
    "web": {
        "port": 8091 // Port you want the web server to listen to
    },
    "paths": {
        "repo_base": "data/" // Where to store the cloned repos
    },
    "github_auth": {
        "user": "USERNAME/token", // username, with /token
        "pw"  : "A__TOKEN__HERE" // Your github token
    },
    "feed": "https://github.com/organizations/ORGANIZATION/USERNAME.private.atom?token=A__TOKEN__HERE", // This could probably be constructed from other info in this file, but I am lazy
    "mongo": "mongodb://localhost/jira" // The mongodb to connect to
}
</code></pre>

h1. what is what?

You start up @reader.js@ to get it all running. It will clone and index all your repos for you
